# Overview

- This is a python script that reads in  xlsx data containing my college schedule for zoom classes and automatically logs me in to class at the correct times.
- This was a good program to help me learn more about how to find different libraries for my purposes and how to trouble shoot my code when using a library for the first time.
- I also was just introduced to using pandas for small databases so was able to increase my knowledge on how that worked.



#### I created a software demo for you to see my script working.

# Development Environment

All the development of this program was done using VScode
I used funtions from the following libraries to create this program
> import webbrowser
import pandas as pd
import schedule
import time

#### Code can be found on my Github linked below

# Useful Websites

I found several websites usefull for the use of these libraries, linked below.
* [Schedule Library Interface](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html)
* [Python Documentation on classes and class functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

# Future Work

There are several things that could really improve this rough first draft
* Creating this script to run as a background task (allowing me to not have a terminal always open)
* Automating/Finding a way to loop and create the jobs instead of coding them individually
* Auotmating/Finding a way to loop and create the scheduler events also instead of doing them invdividually
